Mostly python data stuff. R and crypto stuff coming soon.

So far I have two projects.

1. An analysis of LendingClub portfolios (ipython notebook).  Here, I examine in detail some of the factors that Lending Club could be using to identify risky borrowers (with only data provided by Lending Club, not external data).  This analysis may also help identify potentially mis-priced loans; that is, loans of a given yield that are not necessarily the same risk.

2. A geospacial analysis of zip code and price data (ipython notebook).  This notebook takes zipcodes and translates them to Latitude-Longitude using Google's API.  Then, a simple cluster analysis is performed on the lat-long data using scipy's kmeans2. Finally, this notebook creates a KML file that can be viewed in Google Earth, with some custom features to aid analysis based on the price. 

I'll be adding more stuff soon, in particular some work in R and cryptography.
