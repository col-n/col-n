Mostly python data stuff.

So far I have two projects.

1. An analysis of LendingClub portfolios (ipython notebook).  Here, I examine in detail some of the factors that Lending Club could be used to identify risky borrowers using only data provided by Lending Club.  This analysis can also help identify potentially mis-priced loans (loans that are high yield but not necessarily high risk).

2. An geospacial analysis of zip code and price data (ipython notebook).  This notebook takes zipcodes and translates them to Latitude-Longitude using Google's API.  Then, a simple cluster analysis is performed on the lat-long data using scipy - kmeans2. Finally, this notebook creates a KML file that can be viewed in google earth, with some custom features to aid analysis based on the price. 

I'll be adding more stuff soon.
